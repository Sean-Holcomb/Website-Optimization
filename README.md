# Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

## Running App

1. Download repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)


####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

## Optimization Steps
### Getting pagespeed score above 90
1. Remove blocking css from index.html
 * delete font link tag.
 * add `media='print'` to `<link href="css/print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print">`.
 * move css block `@media only screen and (max-width: 480px)` to new file and link to it with media
  tag `<link href="css/portrait.css" rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 480px)">`
 * inline styles.css.

2. Remove render blocking JS from index.html
 add async to `<script async src="http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script>`

3. Use Build tools to minify and compress
 Using grunt and the pluggins, htmlmin, cssmin, imagemin and uglify. minify and compress resources.

### Getting 60fps for pizza.html

1. Record timeline will resizing pizzas and scrolling page.

2. update changePizzaSize() and delete determineDx() to make pizza resize happen in less than 16ms.

3. In updatePositions() move document call outside of for loop. For better fps design a different calculation for movement that doesnt use Math.sin().

4. Reduce the number of pizzas generated by the DOMContentLoaded event listener.

5. In all loops move document calls and variable creation outside if possible.

6. Replace document.queryAll() calls with document.getElement(s)by() calls

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
